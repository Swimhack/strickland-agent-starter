# Contributing to Strickland AI Agent Starter

Thanks for wanting to contribute. Here's how.

## Quick Version

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-thing`)
3. Make your changes
4. Test them
5. Submit a PR

## What We're Looking For

- **New workflow guides** — CRM integrations, calendar automation, Slack/Discord setups
- **Provider support** — Setup guides for different email, voice, or TTS providers
- **Template improvements** — Better defaults, more examples, clearer comments
- **Bug fixes** — Typos, broken scripts, incorrect instructions
- **Documentation** — Clearer explanations, diagrams, troubleshooting tips

## Standards

- **Write real content.** No placeholder text, no lorem ipsum. Everything should be usable.
- **Test your scripts.** If you add a shell script, run it.
- **Keep the tone.** Technical but accessible. Confident but not arrogant. Read the existing docs for calibration.
- **No API keys.** Ever. Use `YOUR_KEY_HERE` placeholders.

## PR Process

1. **One PR per feature.** Don't bundle unrelated changes.
2. **Describe what and why.** Not just what you changed, but why it matters.
3. **Keep diffs clean.** No IDE config files, no formatting-only changes mixed with real changes.

## Code of Conduct

Be professional. Be constructive. Don't be a jerk.

- Treat others with respect
- Assume good intent
- Focus on the work, not the person
- No harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks

We're building tools for operators. Act like one.
