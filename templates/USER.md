# USER.md — Principal Profile

<!--
  USER.md defines the human your agent serves.
  This helps the agent make better decisions, anticipate needs,
  and communicate appropriately on your behalf.
  
  Fill in what's relevant. Skip what isn't.
  Update this as things change.
-->

## Basic Info

- **Name:** <!-- Your full name -->
- **Role:** <!-- e.g., CEO, Founder, Sales Director -->
- **Company:** <!-- Company name -->
- **Location:** <!-- City, timezone -->
- **Timezone:** <!-- e.g., America/New_York -->

## Communication Style

<!--
  How do YOU communicate? This helps the agent match your voice
  when drafting emails or messages on your behalf.
-->

- **Email tone:** <!-- e.g., Direct and warm. Short paragraphs. Signs off with "Best," -->
- **Texting style:** <!-- e.g., Casual, uses abbreviations, rarely capitalizes -->
- **Meeting style:** <!-- e.g., Prefers agendas, starts on time, action-item focused -->

## Priorities

<!--
  What matters most right now? Update this weekly or when priorities shift.
  Your agent uses this to triage and make judgment calls.
-->

1. <!-- e.g., Close Q1 pipeline — 3 deals in final stages -->
2. <!-- e.g., Hire senior engineer — interviews scheduled this week -->
3. <!-- e.g., Product launch prep — deadline Feb 15 -->

## Schedule Preferences

- **Best meeting times:** <!-- e.g., Tue-Thu, 10am-3pm -->
- **No-meeting blocks:** <!-- e.g., Monday mornings, Friday afternoons -->
- **Recurring commitments:** <!-- e.g., Team standup daily 9am, board meeting first Monday -->
- **Buffer preference:** <!-- e.g., 15 min between meetings -->

## Key Contacts

<!--
  People your agent will interact with frequently.
  Include relationship context so the agent knows the dynamic.
-->

| Name | Role | Relationship | Notes |
|------|------|-------------|-------|
| <!-- e.g., Sarah Chen --> | <!-- CTO --> | <!-- Co-founder, close friend --> | <!-- Prefers Slack, very direct --> |
| <!-- e.g., Mike Ross --> | <!-- Lead investor --> | <!-- Board member --> | <!-- Formal emails, cc his EA --> |
| <!-- e.g., Dana Park --> | <!-- EA --> | <!-- Your assistant --> | <!-- Coordinates calendar --> |

## Preferences & Pet Peeves

<!--
  The small things that make the difference between a good assistant
  and one that actually knows you.
-->

- <!-- e.g., Hates unnecessary meetings — always ask "could this be an email?" -->
- <!-- e.g., Prefers bullet points over paragraphs -->
- <!-- e.g., Always wants to know the "why" behind a recommendation -->
- <!-- e.g., Doesn't drink coffee — don't suggest coffee meetings -->

## Decision-Making Context

<!--
  Help your agent understand how you make decisions.
  This is useful when the agent needs to triage or prioritize.
-->

- **Risk tolerance:** <!-- e.g., Moderate. Will take calculated bets but wants data. -->
- **Decision speed:** <!-- e.g., Fast on reversible decisions, deliberate on irreversible ones. -->
- **Delegation comfort:** <!-- e.g., High for ops, low for customer-facing messaging. -->

## Goals

<!--
  Longer-term context. What are you building toward?
  This helps the agent connect daily tasks to bigger objectives.
-->

- **This quarter:** <!-- e.g., Hit $500K ARR, hire 2 engineers -->
- **This year:** <!-- e.g., Series A, launch enterprise tier -->
- **Longer term:** <!-- e.g., Build the definitive AI agent platform -->
